            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe fear of the Justice of the Law whose Tryall many durst not stand, made <hi>Finch</hi> and <hi>Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank</hi> fly, when they saw their Plots and Counsels took no successe, providing for their own security by flight, and rather cozen the Law, by their heels then their wits, which had bin long hatching.</p>
            <p>From Justice and this Kingdome they fled into <hi>France,</hi> and this have for a long space token sanctuary, and beene secure from the deserved censure and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And now observe how this wicked
<pb facs="tcp:156806:3"/> minded persons do still prosecute, that in-bred and naturall desire of mischief, which they alwayes affected.</p>
            <p>For now, even against that place, and those persons who were the Authors and means of their preservation and being; these persons had conspired Ruine and Destruction.</p>
            <p>Like the ingratefull Viper, who being almost starved with cold, found from the Husbandman Charity and warmth, and was preserved from Death, which at the last turned his sting to wound that brest which had bin his defence from Death and Calamity.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Finch</hi> and <hi>Windebank</hi> not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great benefit and advantage they had received by the Court of <hi>France</hi> had conspired to take away the life of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Cardinall Richlieu</hi> whom they could by no means indure to comply with their Conspiracies and trecheries.</p>
            <p>Having thus plott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:156806:3"/> bin succesfull, they knew they could not long want encouragement and assistance for further mischief; neither did their Designs desist here for having thus mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the King and the Cardinals, if any Protestants could have bin found, they must have bin the subjects of their next cruelty, and have made the next Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>These things being dispatched, they then would have addressed themselves against this Kingdom, and would have endeavoured to have brought those plots, and designs to passe, which by reason of the most fortunate Discovery they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
